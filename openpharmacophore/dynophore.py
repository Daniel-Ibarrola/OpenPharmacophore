    # Frequency: 
    #       1.  Derive a pharmacophore model for each frame.
    #       2.  Count the frequency of each feature. For the frequency we don't take the coordinates
    #           into account. Just the feature type and the atoms that are part of that feature.
    #       3.  Calculate frequency in terms of percentage.
    #       4.  Create a plot of frequency (%) vs time.
    #       5.  Depending on the frequency of each feature, different pharmacophore
    #           models can be derived.
    #           
    #           Features that have really low frequencies can be disregarded. (maybe < 5%)
    #           Features can be grouped by time-steps. Features with high frequency in some time-step
    #           can be used to build a pharmacophore model, while the ones that have low frequency in that
    #           time-step are not part of that pharmacophore model.           
    #
    #       6. How do we obtain the coordinates of the pharmacophore models? 
    #           Perhaps we could take the average for those timesteps.
    #
    #       7. This method can give one or more pharmacophores.

    # Common-Hits-Approach (CHA):
    #       Step 1. Getting Representative Pharmacophore Models.
    #
    #       1. Derive a pharmacophore model for each frame of the trajectory.
    #       2. Each pharmacophore can be respresented with a coordinates matrix and a feature vector, that is a vector with just
    #          the type of the features and no coordinates. 
    #       3. All pharmacophores with the same feature vector are reduced to only one. This is called the representative
    #          pharmacophore model or RPM.
    #       4. Get all unique pharmacophore features in all the trajectory (just feature type and atoms that are part of the feature).
    #          Build a vector with this features, unique features vector.
    #       5. Get all distint feature vectors by observing the feature vectors at each time step. 
    #          
    #          The feature vectors can be built as bit vectors with 1 corresponding to features
    #          that are present in the unique features vector and 0 to features which are not.
    #          
    #          Consider only vectors with an appereance count >= 2.
    #       6. For each time step a distinct feature vector appears, compute the conformational energy of the ligand. Save
    #          all of these energies and pick the median energy.
    #       7. Get the pharmacophore coordinates of the ligand with median energy.
    #       8. Build the RPM with the coordinates and the distinct feature vector
    #       9. Go back to 6 and repeat for all distinct feature vectors to get all RPMs for the system. 
    #
    #       Step 2. CHA
    #       1. Perform screening with each RPM.
    #       2. Compare lists of hits to find best phamracophore.
